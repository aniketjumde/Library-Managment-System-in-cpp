# Library-Managment-System-in-cpp

**Introduction**

This code implements a simple library management system in C++. It includes classes for managing login credentials, book entries, and student information. The program allows users to log in with a username and password, register books in the library, issue books, and register student information.

Login Class : The Login class handles user authentication by verifying the entered username and password.

BookEntry Class : The BookEntry class manages book registration, storing details such as book name, author, publisher, ISBN, edition, and publish year. It provides functions to register books, display registered books, and save book data to a file.

StudentEntry Class : The StudentEntry class manages student information, including name, address, email, and student ID. It provides functions to register student details and save them to a file.

The main function initiates the login process, allowing access to the library management system upon successful authentication. Users can then choose options to register books, issue books, or register student information, with data being saved to respective files for future reference.
